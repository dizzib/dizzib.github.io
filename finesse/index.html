<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Finesse is an arcade puzzle game for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</a> which I wrote in 1991 but never released until now.</p>

<p>Finesse should run in any decent Atari ST emulator such as <a href="https://code.google.com/p/steem-engine/">Steem</a> running TOS v1.62.
Download, unzip and run <a href="finexe.zip">the disk image</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-arena">The Arena</h2>
<p>At the centre of the screen is a bat which you can rotate, surrounded by clusters of light bulbs.</p>
<p>Each bulb can be lit in one of seven different colours, or off.</p>
<p>A coloured ring around a bulb indicates its target colour:
<img src="asset/target.gif" alt="Target"></p>
<p>In each cluster the bulb nearest the bat is the prime-bulb, encircled by dots:
<img src="asset/prime.gif" alt="Target"></p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>The clusters are affected by small coloured pyramids which bounce around the screen:
<img src="asset/pyramid.gif" alt="Target"></p>
<p>When a pyramid strikes a cluster:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>if the prime-bulb is off, then the bulb lights up in the pyramid&#39;s colour.</p>
</li>
<li><p>if the prime-bulb is lit in the pyramid&#39;s colour, then the bulb turns off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>otherwise:</p>
<p> a) if the cluster contains a bulb of the pyramid&#39;s colour, then it rotates one place clockwise.</p>
<p> b) otherwise the pyramid changes colour to that of the prime-bulb</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A level is complete when all the ringed bulbs are lit in their target colours.
There are 100 levels to complete.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>Press <strong>fire</strong> to start,
then type a 4-digit passcode to enter a later level or press <strong>fire</strong> again to start at level 1.</p>
<p>At the start of each level you are given a number of finesses (moves).
The countdown gives you a little time to think ahead before the first pyramid is injected.</p>
<p>The colours of one or more pyramids are shown just above the countdown after which the leftmost
pyramid is injected first, followed by the others.</p>
<p>During play, a pyramid striking the arena&#39;s edge reduces the number of finesses by 1.
When this reaches zero the game ends.</p>
<p>To help you progress, a 4-digit passcode is shown after every 5 levels.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have a joystick, a good emulator should let you map your keyboard to joystick left/right and fire.</p>
<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>1 point for each finesse left in the level-intro countdown after <strong>fire</strong> is pressed.</p>
<p>5 points for each lit bulb at the end of a level.</p>
