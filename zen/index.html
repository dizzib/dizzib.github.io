<h3 id="saving-multiple-game-positions-for-backtracking">Saving multiple game positions for backtracking</h3>
<p>Zen allows only a single saved game position i.e. pressing <strong>f0</strong> will overwrite the previously saved position,
so you might be tempted to use <a href="http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/">BeebEm</a>&#39;s <strong>File -&gt; Load/Save State</strong> command.
Unfortunately this won&#39;t work because Zen saves room/object state to disc.</p>
<p>The proper way to save a position is to take a copy of <strong>Zen.2012.REL.ssd</strong> after saving position and rename it
to something descriptive. Then simply restore this SSD if you need to backtrack.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re having technical issues or you&#39;re stuck in the game with no clue how to proceeed then
please visit <a href="http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=5265">the Zen discussion thread on the Stairway to Hell forums</a>.</p>
<h2 id="development-background">Development Background</h2>
<p>I started writing Zen in 1987 when I was 17 and finished a <a href="1988/Zen.1988.REL.zip">a demo version</a> in 1988.
Unfortunately it never got released probably because it was insanely difficult
plus it had a bug which made it impossible to complete!
Also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a> were increasingly dominating the home computer scene.</p>
<p>The original 25-year-old floppy disks were barely readable so rescuing the source was a close run thing.
Indeed, one of the source files <em>was</em> unreadable but amazingly I discovered a hard-copy so was able
to resuce it by OCR from a scan !</p>
<p>I spent 3 months of Summer 2012 hacking the source to bring it up to release quality by
fixing bugs, improving graphics/puzzles and layout of some rooms, and by adding 3 difficulty levels.</p>
<p>Zen is written in 6502 assembler.
Interestingly, since Zen makes heavy use of the disk it actually runs better from a virtual SSD in <a href="http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/">BeebEm</a>
compared with a physical disk drive!</p>
<p>Some technical highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>rooms are stored on disk and read in dynamically</li>
<li>some program code is swapped in and out of memory from disk at runtime</li>
<li>a screen split allows up to 8 colours in mode 5 (normally just 4 colours)</li>
</ul>
