<p>The best way to run this game is in the excellent <a href="http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/">BeebEm</a> emulator on a Windows PC:</p>

<ol>

  <li>download <a href="2012/Zen.2012.REL.zip">Zen.2012.REL.zip</a> then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Info-ZIP">unzip</a> the SSD and run it via <strong>File -&gt; Run Disc</strong>.</li>
  <li>optionally, to speed up moving between rooms uncheck <strong>Sound -&gt; Sound Effects -&gt; Disc Drives</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="players-guide">Player&rsquo;s Guide</h2>

<div class="img-list itemised">

<img src="asset/food-cone.gif" alt="Drink" />
<img src="asset/food-wine.gif" alt="Drink" />
<img src="asset/food-chicken.gif" alt="Chicken" />
Fighting monsters is hungry work so eat plenty of food to stay alive &lsquo;cos if your life hits zero it&rsquo;s game over.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/cash-coin.gif" alt="Cash" />
<img src="asset/cash-bag.gif" alt="Cash" />
<img src="asset/cash-chest.gif" alt="Cash" />
Collect coins, money-bags and treasure-chests to boost your cash reserves.
Local currency is the Zenq, accepted by all vending machines!</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/arrows.gif" alt="Arrows" />
A pile of 10 silver-tipped arrows, deadly to most monsters. Your quiver can hold up to 50.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/potion.gif" alt="Potion" />
A random potion can help or hinder so is it worth the risk ?</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/key.gif" alt="Key" />
<img src="asset/door.gif" alt="Key" />
A door&rsquo;s number is found by walking up to it. Only a key of the same number will unlock it.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/guard.gif" alt="Guard" />
Guards move to a set pattern.
Because they&rsquo;re actually ghosts of past soldiers they can only be killed by silver-tipped arrows
(some guards are immune). Guards can pass through solid matter.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/ghoul-spikey.gif" alt="Ghoul" />
<img src="asset/ghoul-monk.gif" alt="Ghoul" />
<img src="asset/ghoul-gumph.gif" alt="Ghoul" />
<img src="asset/ghoul-bird.gif" alt="Ghoul" />
Ghouls appear randomly throughout the kingdom and though shortlived, pose a serious threat to your health.
They are destroyed by any contact with solid objects and on dying may turn into ghosts.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/ghost.gif" alt="Ghost" />
Ghosts are very dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.
They follow you relentlessly and cannot be destroyed.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <p><img src="asset/vendor.gif" alt="Vending machine" />
Walk up to a vending machine to see the amount of life-points sold per Zenq, from 1 to 4.

<h3 id="saving-multiple-game-positions-for-backtracking">Saving multiple game positions for backtracking</h3>

<p>Zen allows only a single saved game position i.e. pressing <strong>f0</strong> will overwrite the previously saved position,
so you might be tempted to use <a href="http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/">BeebEm</a>&rsquo;s <strong>File -&gt; Load/Save State</strong> command.
Unfortunately this won&rsquo;t work because Zen saves room/object state to disc.</p>

<p>The proper way to save a position is to take a copy of <strong>Zen.2012.REL.ssd</strong> after saving position and rename it
to something descriptive. Then simply restore this SSD if you need to backtrack.</p>

<h2 id="development-background">Development Background</h2>

<p>I started writing Zen in 1987 when I was 17 and finished a <a href="1988/Zen.1988.REL.zip">a demo version</a> in 1988.
Unfortunately it never got released probably because it was insanely difficult
plus it had a bug which made it impossible to complete!
Also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari ST</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a> were increasingly dominating the home computer scene.</p>

<p>The original 25-year-old floppy disks were barely readable so rescuing the source was a close run thing.
Indeed, one of the source files <em>was</em> unreadable but amazingly I discovered a hard-copy so was able
to resuce it by OCR from a scan !</p>

<p>I spent 3 months of Summer 2012 hacking the source to bring it up to release quality by
fixing bugs, improving graphics/puzzles and layout of some rooms, and by adding 3 difficulty levels.</p>

<p>Zen is written in 6502 assembler.
Interestingly, since Zen makes heavy use of the disk it actually runs better from a virtual SSD in <a href="http://www.mkw.me.uk/beebem/">BeebEm</a>
compared with a physical disk drive!</p>

<p>Some technical highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rooms are stored on disk and read in dynamically</li>
  <li>some program code is swapped in and out of memory from disk at runtime</li>
  <li>a screen split allows up to 8 colours in mode 5 (normally just 4 colours)</li>
</ul>
